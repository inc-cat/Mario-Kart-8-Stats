# Evie and inc play Mario Kart!

## Introduction

Evie and inc have been playing [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Mario-Kart-8-Deluxe-1173281.html) and have wanted to settle the dispute of who is the better of the two once and for all.

Mario Kart 8 is a kart racing game where players control characters from the Mario universe to race in go-karts around specified courses. They may hinder their opponents or improve their performance using power-ups found in item boxes throughout the course. It includes four different difficulties, each differing in speed, which may be selected before the race. "Mirror Mode" horizontally inverts all courses.

## Races and results

Typically races have 12 participants and the higher a player places at the end of the race, the more points a player will earn.
Point distributions are as follows:

| Position | Points awarded |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 1st      | 15             |
| 2nd      | 12             |
| 3rd      | 10             |
| 4th      | 9              |
| 5th      | 8              |
| 6th      | 7              |
| 7th      | 6              |
| 8th      | 5              |
| 9th      | 4              |
| 10th     | 3              |
| 11th     | 2              |
| 12th     | 1              |

## Recording and displaying scores

- Filter menus are available to sort through results.
